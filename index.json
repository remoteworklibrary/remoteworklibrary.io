[{"categories":["tool","culture","practice"],"contents":"When working remotely trust within in a new team isn\u0026rsquo;t something that builds up naturally: Here are some research results and hands-on advice on how to foster swift trust in virtual teams and achieve better project communication and results.\nTrust is saving time and money Research shows the success of a team heavily depends on trusting relationships between team members (e.g. Jarvenpaa/Knoll/Leidner 1998 1; Gilson/Maynard/Young 2015 2) - meaning those teams are more proactive, more focused and provide better feedback (Clark/ Clark/Crossley 2010 3). Team members have to trust one another, the team leader and also the organization they work in to be productive. Trust here is defined as „an individual’s willingness to be vulnerable to the actions of another person.” (Mayer/Davis/Schoorman 1995, S. 710 4).\nTrust seems to be even more important if it comes to semi-remote, remote and/or agile teams, where you cannot actually watch your team members work.\nHow people build trust The ease of team members building trust depends on individual and organizational criteria: First of all building trust is a matter of ones personality type – some people are more trusting then others. Others are using stereotypes to conclude trustworthiness. Still others watch closely how new people around them act before they build up trust.\nAbove all, trust is built\n when people meet in person (Snow/Snell/Davison 1996 5) after frequent (and successful) interactions (McAllister 1995 6) when employees have the opportunity to directly observe what others do (Aubert/Kelsey 20037)  Obviously this makes virtual teams trust-killers: You don’t meet and observing your team members work directly is a real struggle. Therefore, building (swift) trust in remote teams is a task that needs time and attention.\nDo‘s and Don‘ts for building trust Do: Take care of initial interactions that help bonding Swift trust is established at the phase of the team formation through initial interactions (Clark et al. 2010). At this stage, when trust has only been started to be built, the first impression is telling: i.e. how fast is information flowing between team members? Small hints are (over-)interpreted: e.g. How long does it take to get an email reply from my colleague? Technology but also communication rules can help, as stated below.\nDo: Provide best-in-class technology Since virtual teams absolutely need to rely on technology-mediated communication, one success factor of remote teams is to provide the team with the most supportive technological infrastructure. We have all had the email not reaching its intentional goal or the call cancelled because of bad connection. Technology has to be safe, rich (capable of more than only text) and reliable. Make sure that technology used is seemlessly compatible among the team members (Ford et al. 2017 8).\nDo: Provide roles and rules of communication Unclear roles and rules of communication lead to misunderstandings and hinder trust building. E.g. when team members need to wait for days to get login-credentials and still don‘t see all necessary info, trust – to the team as well as the organization – is not fostered. Therefore establish and use communication rules like a maximum response time. Also make a backup plan for inevitable failures of preferred communication tools - there comes a moment when a tool fails. For remote teams, that means communication breakdown!\nDon’t: Build semi-remote teams Local members of semi-virtual teams report much more positive perceptions of their local than their remote members, while perception is similar in fully traditional or fully virtual teams. We can draw implications for practice here, such as the avoidance of semi-virtual teams whenever possible and the development of strong team identities (Webster/Wong, 2008 9)\nThis is, because a „team“ of co-located and virtual team members form sub-groups, which according to Burke and Aytes (2002, p. 39 10) leads to group-within-a-group behaviour, i.e. lower interaction of local with remote team-members, resulting in higher conflicts and lower communication and satisfaction (Axtell et al. 2004 11).\nA simple example: The co-located members of the team discussed solutions first-handedly and presented them to remote members only later on. The effect was that these solutions were turned down more often than between co-located teams. So semi-remote teams should be avoided. If that is not possible, take the time to let informal communication happen (see tipps below), also bring the team together in person as often as possible esp. at the beginning.\nDo: Put emphasis on getting to know each other as human individuals Onboarding is crucial to new team members – this is true for co-local teams and virtual teams.\nFord et al. (2017) 8 state that an onboarding process for remote teams should include information about team members and their personal background, working style and idiosyncrasies – all information that „face-to-face team members typically acquire informally and that create a sense of familiarity with other members.“\nWhile information about professional qualifications or the role in the team seems to be useful and feasible, trying to grasp work style and personal backgrounds obviously could fail miserably. An explicit „dossier“ about the morning grouches in your team might not create a trustful athmosphere…\nThe better option is to include opportunities for informal contact with each team member so people can build relationships.\nThe following two games I recently tried can help provide a setting where people get to know the person behind the role:\nGetting to know each other – remote The „Show your Homescreen“-Game Why use it? Everyone lives with and through his or her smartphone everyday. Get a quick clue what matters to your team members in every day life.\nHow does it work? Easy as pie: Let your team members upload a screenshot of their smartphone (or Desktop) homescreen e.g. via Padlet.com or in your company’s chat tool. Next every team member shows his screen and tells the others about the 3-4 most used or most important apps in their daily life. You quickly get to know: Does my co-worker travel a lot, does he or she work out (Fitnesstrackers…), read the news or go hiking …\nFor whom? Teams up to 10 people, it takes 2-3 min per Person\nThe Empathy Map – of your team From my personal experience, this one was a real eye-opener: How do our colleagues see you, your role and what you do? I was heavily convinced my co-workers were bored by the tasks we worked on at that time of the project. It came out they weren‘t, but still they wanted to know the larger perspective on why we do certain tasks or follow certain strategies.\nThe Empathy Map is taken from the great book „Game storming“ (Gray/Brown 2011 12). Though it is originally used to create customer profiles, we used it once in a team workshop to put ourselves in the perspective of a colleague from another work area and get to know their challenges and needs.\nWhy use it? With multi-skilled teams from different work areas like Development, IT-Infrastructure, UX/UI, Product Owner and Editorial Board all of these groups have different views and different stakeholders – which they hardly know about\nHow to do it? Seperate team members into groups with people from the same work areas – e.g. group all Devs together. Now take a look at the Empathy Map and reflect on your co-workers in that group:\nWhat do they see in their normal work environment? This could mean real entities like buildings, screens but also their bosses‘ face behind a glass door or also „no-one except their two group members.“\nWhat do they say? What phrases are commonly used? E.g. „We are deploying today.“ Or „Of course we can do that.“ „I need more specification to build that.“ Etc.\nWhat do they hear? Sentences that describe the messages they get like „Can you alter that by the end of the day?“ „Does it really take that long?“\nWhat do they feel like during work? Bored? Exhausted? Overwhelmed? Like Super-Heroes? What do they do? Code? Discuss? Design wireframes? List what you think and also, what takes the most time!\nNow present the results to the group you reflected on – do so first, without interruptions from the intended group and discuss later. Were you close or totally wrong with your assumptions? What are the challenges for you all as a team? People often have no real clue which tasks their coworkers have in daily worklife.\nFor whom? Heterogene Teams, up to 4 different groups\n   img.lazyload { display: none; }    Empathy Map Canvas (source: Updated Empathy Map Canvas)   Further information Related items  Strategies to foster resilience in virtual teams Team Health Checks  Sources   Jarvenpaa, S.

If you are mindful, you will notice more quickly when you are tired, or when a meeting has ended with an ambiguity.\nIf you are mindful, you perceive your counterpart better. How is your colleague really doing? Did he really understand what you told him? Is there irritation between you, or do you get along well?\nMindful people are more empathic, they experience fewer conflicts and are more satisfied at work. They also recognize their personal limits easier. In the home office it is more difficult to perceive oneself and others. Attention is very focused on the laptop, and the natural body language in any encounter is limited to a few elements, which can also provide opportunities for misunderstandings.\nFor self-awareness despite being at your home office you can do the following:\n Take a break once an hour at work, during which you can get up, stretch, maybe open the window, and consciously recognize how you are feeling. Establish good habits that help you do what is important for your balance. Spend at least half an hour on your own, without distraction from digital media. Go for a walk, clean up in peace, meditate, or read a book  For a mindful approach to others you can do the following:\n Ask in meetings what your counterpart has understood exactly and if he or she has more questions. Ask how your counterpart is doing personally. As spontaneous conversations at the coffee machine do not take place, more explicit interest is needed. Mirror your observations: You look as if you are in a good mood today, or: you look tired today, and ask if your impression is right. Deliberately give appreciation. Thank others for work done, praise good results or diligence, or simply support spontaneously.

You join those collaboration spaces to let serendipitous moments happen, get the awareness who is \u0026ldquo;in the office\u0026rdquo; right now, and for deep collaborative work.\nThere are at least three different categories of virtual collaboration spaces:\nVirtual Offices This kind of virtual collaboration spaces tries to simulate office spaces where avatars can move around on a virtual office floor and video, and voice interactions are possible. Those interactions can be started by moving into dedicated meeting rooms (like in Remo) or just by being close to each other (like in Gather).\n   img.lazyload { display: none; }    Source: https://www.sococo.com/why-sococo/   Other virtual office solutions are Sococco, Workabout Workplace, Wurkr, Pragli or the open source virtual office by our friends at TNG. All those virtual offices are accessed by a browser.\nXR Collaboration Spaces XR Collaboration Spaces create digital collaboration spaces in virtual or augmented reality. With VR headsets like Oculus Quest which is standalone and affordable or impressive AR solutions like the Microsoft Hololens 2 this technology might be close to a broader adoption. XR Collaboration Spaces like Glue, Immersed and Spatial provide amazing collaboration capabilities like digital whiteboards where everybody can draw with a virtual pen, digital 2D or 3D assets which can be displayed or a digital twin of your monitor output. Voice is always on with a spatial sound: As closer you get to the avatar the louder you can hear the voice.\n   img.lazyload { display: none; }    Source: https://glue.work/   Metaverses A Metaverse is a collective virtual shared space where people can meet, socialize and collaborate. It\u0026rsquo;s quite close to XR Collaboration Spaces but with a broader use case. Some say Metaverses are the future of social networks and the internet in general. Early Metaverses like Mozilla Hubs (Open Source) and Facebook Horizon (currently in beta) might be indicators for that. With Metaverses you can build your own XR Collaboration Spaces as well as rooms where employees can just hangout together and have some serendipities.\nVoice Chatrooms Voice Chatrooms are always open voice chats. Everybody joining has no barrier to communicate: just speak if you\u0026rsquo;ve something to say and the others will (hopefully) listen in realtime. This technique is often used in online gaming sessions but is also helpful during other collaborative activities like pair programming or writing a document together simultaneously. Voice Chatrooms can be realized with tools like Teamspeak, Discord (mind their weak privacy) or just always open Zoom rooms.\n","permalink":"https://www.remoteworklibrary.io/posts/virtual-collaboration-spaces/","tags":["collaborate","rejuvenate","socialize"],"title":"Virtual Collaboration Spaces"},{"categories":["culture","practice"],"contents":"Breaks are important. Whether at the water cooler, the coffee machine or the tea kettle: Taking breaks, especially together with your colleagues, is important. What usually just happens in normal office routine needs some assistance in a remote work situation.\nWhat is a Virtual Coffee Break? In a normal office environment, coffee breaks (or tea, \u0026hellip;) are part of the daily routine. Many of these coffee breaks are based on the serendipity principle: In these planned or unplanned meetings in the cafeteria or in the office kitchen, unexpected but valuable information is often exchanged and you are talking about topics that one did not expect on the way to the cafeteria. To ensure that serendipity is not lost in Remote Work, various technical solutions and rituals can be used. Because one thing is guaranteed: A remote worker regularly needs joint coffee breaks with his colleagues far away.\nHow to do it? The first step are virtual meeting areas, whose entry barriers should be very low (easy technical access, no closing times or self-service).\nA very simple solution for this is video conferencing, which is active 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. These conferences can be entered as spontaneously as a coffee kitchen and hopefully you will meet nice colleagues there. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to rely on that, you can use a ritual of getting together. In real office life, you walk through the floor and ask \u0026ldquo;Coffee?\u0026rdquo; or clink the coffee cups a little bit louder and colleagues that have time and desire are attracted. In a remote setting, this ritual can be most easily illustrated with a chat. Create a special \u0026ldquo;Coffee Buddies\u0026rdquo; channel or use your team channel to send a small coffee cup of emoji. This sends a signal to your colleagues: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to have a coffee now. Who wants to come along? Meet me at the Zoom Coffee Kitchen\u0026rdquo;. An emoji is quickly sent, quickly read or quickly ignored if you want to continue working.\n   img.lazyload { display: none; }    Coffee cup emoji in Slack channel   Scheduled Coffee Breaks If you don\u0026rsquo;t have the possibility of virtual coffee kitchens, you can also set up classic meetings via calendar: One-time, or series. With one colleague or with a group. You decide. You can easily schedule a coffee break meeting in your business calendar (e.g. Google Calendar) and link it to a video conference session (e.g. 1-click solution with Zoom\u0026rsquo;s Google Calendar plugin).\n   Search for the person in calendar Select time and write your purpose (e.g. \u0026ldquo;Coffee Break Session\u0026rdquo;) in the title Add a Zoom meeting  Chatbots Chatbots can be used in this ritual to ensure that as many different people as possible meet in the coffee kitchen and to increase randomness. There are many offers for this in the Slack Marketplace:\n Donut: https://slack.com/apps/A11MJ51SR-donut RandomCoffees: https://slack.com/apps/A5JR8MM6E-randomcoffees Lean Coffee Table: https://slack.com/apps/AC5RRA4N6-lean-coffee-table Snack: https://slack.com/apps/A010GH02MCY-snack  These bots are especially useful for colleagues who are new in a company and want to get in touch with their new colleagues. This is where the random selection of coffee rounds helps enormously. We at QAware use the Donut Chatbot for this. Everybody who wants to join a coffee buddy session has to join the channel \u0026ldquo;Coffee Buddies\u0026rdquo;. The bot randomly sets up buddy rounds once a week with a group of three colleagues. By the calendar integration it is also very easy to find and create a calender invitation (incl. zoom dial-in).

But how can you do remote team events on a larger scale?\nWhat is a Remote Team Event and why use it? Team events offer the opportunity to meet colleagues and team members outside regular work meetings – in a casual atmosphere. Usually we have several company wide events with 100 to 200 participants throughout the year, so we asked ourselves: how can we map that to a remote setting?\nHow to do it? Provide a dedicated and always-open videoconferencing session for virtual coffee breaks as well as a mechanism to see if anybody is in the session before joining to lower the barrier.\nTooling Even though a regular video conferencing tool like Zoom offers to host events with 200 and more participants, it is rather difficult to network as only one person can speak at a time (when one person speaks the other ones are automatically muted). Of course there are break out rooms, with which you can divide the group into smaller groups. But only the host can allocate the team members and it is not possible to see who is in which room.\nTherefore we searched for a tool that can solve these problems and we finally found remo.co. Remo offers simple but helpful features:\n There is an event floor with tables for six people each On the event floor you can see who participates in the event and who is sitting at which table By double-clicking on a table, participants can easily switch between tables At each table you can see the other people sitting at the same table and talk to them (like a mini video conference) As a host you have a broadcast function, with which you can talk to all event participants at the same time It is even possible to design a branded event floor     img.lazyload { display: none; }    Remo example floor plan   All in all Remo offers event participants more rights and due to the floor plan the feeling of being together at the same event is much stronger.\nGames It is always fun to have games at such an event and there are a lot of online games that you can play without being physically together. We were looking for games that do not take a lot of time, do not need a lot of explanation and are great fun. Our favorite game during the event was: skribbl.io: One person gets a word that she/he has to draw with the mouse - the other people have to guess the word in the game chat. The earlier you identify the word, the more points you get. The person with the most points wins the game. – simple but lots of fun!\nCatering On a good event, a good catering cannot be missing. We chose a simple way and gave out online vouchers for a supermarket chain to all event participants. This way everyone could get their favorite food and drinks.\nThe first remote team event went very well and the feedback was amazing. So we will have more remote team events soon.\nFurther information Related items  Video Conferencing ","permalink":"https://www.remoteworklibrary.io/posts/remote-team-events/","tags":["socialize","serendipity"],"title":"Remote Team Events"},{"categories":["practice","tool","culture"],"contents":"Health checks are a special form of feedback from colleagues in the team or company regarding how they are currently doing: mental, satisfaction with processes, tooling and goals.\nWhat is a Team Health Check and why use it? Health checks should normally be part of every retro. But in some situations it is useful to do additional health checks. This is the case, for example, if the frequency of the retros is not so often (\u0026gt; 2 weeks) or retros are not made regularly. Another reason for special health checks may be that team members in the larger video call session are shy and frightened of their personal feedback.\nHow to do it? 1-on-1 Meeting Every manager, team leader, agile master should do a short video call once a week with each team member. In a relaxed atmosphere for a short exchange. How are you doing? What was bothering or causing you problems at the job this week? Maybe I can help you? What did you enjoy most about your job this week? Tell something about your week so that your colleague can get to know your topics.\nIf you work geographically distributed these regular meetings are very important. If you are not working site-by-site in one office, these conversations do not happen by chance. They must be done explicit. They must become routine without becoming boring and redundant. This is not easy. Every manager has to find an authentic way and establish a good relationship to the employees.\nTeam Health Checks A popular model for team health checks was developed by Spotify, the \u0026ldquo;Squad Health Check Model\u0026rdquo;. This model has two goals: What is the current situation and what is the trend. Thus this model is similar to some maturity models.\nWho is the Health Check Model intended for? In the Health Check Model of a Squad (Spotify`s term for a small, interdisciplinary, self-organized development team) there are mainly two stakeholders:\n The Squad itself: By discussing the individual factors, the members of the squad can better understand what works and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for them. The wide range of questions helps them to better understand the current state of the team. They may be aware of the quality issues in the code, but they haven\u0026rsquo;t really thought about the value from the customer\u0026rsquo;s point of view or how quickly they can learn. It also highlights both the good things and the negative points. People who support the squad: Managers, coaches, other team leaders who work outside the team get an overview of all the things that work and those that don\u0026rsquo;t work. Additionally, they can see patterns between different squads. If you have dozens of teams and can\u0026rsquo;t talk to everyone about everything, such a summary can help you to find out what\u0026rsquo;s really important.  Being aware of the problem is the first step to solving a problem. This type of visualization makes it much harder to ignore a problem.\n   img.lazyload { display: none; }    Squad Health Check model (source: https://labs.spotify.com)   Mood Checks Health checks in the very small Mood Check format \u0026ldquo;How are you doing: good, ok, bad\u0026rdquo; are not ideal for obtaining detailed and regular feedback from the team. But: They are a good icebreaker for retro meeting.\n   img.lazyload { display: none; }    Mood Check   TeamRetro An exemplary online tool for retros and health checks is TeamRetro.

In the home office these structures are missing. If you want, you can spend the whole day in 10 square meters without moving from your laptop.

For example, if you want to eat less sweets, do not buy them. If there are any for your children, put them out of reach so that it is more difficult to get them Facilitate new good habits to get into your life by bringing them into the center of your space. If you want to go jogging in the morning, put your shoes right in front of the bed and sleep the first few nights in your jogging suit. If you want to meditate for 10 minutes after lunch, set the timer to remind you during the first weeks. You want to talk to your favorite colleagues?

This article shows some impulses how virtual teams can become more resilient in their teamwork.\nWhat is resilience and where does it help? Resilience means psychosocial resistance, the ability to successfully cope with unexpected, surprising, or particularly difficult life events. In other words: to be strong and flexible. Resilience also contributes to better mental health, higher job and career satisfaction, greater ties to the company, a higher level of work engagement, and greater openness to change in companies (Hartmann et al., 2020 1). However, resilience does not only affect individuals but is also found in teams and organizations. How does resilience in teams emerge? The more positive interactions there are in a group, the better the resilience of the group. This strengthens cohesion and satisfaction in the group.\nChallenges for virtual teams Due to the lack of personal interaction in virtual teams, it is more difficult to assess the personal situation (e.g., has financial difficulties) and the social context of the other team members (e.g., has to care for three children in the home office). For example, if a team member is not well prepared for a meeting, a reproach quickly arises: “He\u0026rsquo;s lazy.” In addition, building relationships and noticing and interpreting important stimuli in the virtual world is much more challenging. Is my workmate frowning because he contests what I have recently said? Or does he have trouble with technology? Is the colleague sick or does she just look very pale on the screen? The more complex the team\u0026rsquo;s work becomes, the more challenges can occur on the way to the goal, such as time pressure or overload, or acute problems such as a problem with a supplier or a conflict with another team member. If the difficult conditions of virtual work are added, it can severely affect team performance and collaboration.\nWhat distinguishes resilient virtual teams? Degbey and Einola 2 surveyed several virtual teams and observed how they deal with challenges. They assume that daily interaction with each other is crucial for building team resilience, similar to a muscle that is growing with each training session. Only a part of the teams studied had become resilient. But these teams managed to adapt dynamically to challenges such as misunderstandings, major problems with technology, and performance or time pressure.\nDegbey and Einola 2 explained this as follows: If an event occurs, a search for the causes and an interpretation of the situation is automatically carried out. This automatism helps us to make sense of ambiguous situations and is crucial for the next steps a team is taking. Depending on how these steps are designed in the team, they strengthen or weaken the flexibility and resilience of teams. Successful teams are characterized by:\n Self-reflective practices The active regulation of emotions Practices to involve the team in finding solutions and handling tasks  These teams built resilience from within and were better prepared for challenges. They initiated a positive cycle of building resilience and sustained excellence and successfully managed project by project in a turbulent environment with changing tasks, shorter deadlines, and time pressure. Less resilient teams experienced exactly the reverse process: a vicious cycle. Situations were misinterpreted and not reflected on, and negative emotions were expressed, which often led to even more tensions in the team which complicated the joint search for solutions.\nThis is what people in virtual teams can do Self-reflection  Exercise mindfulness: Only when you are mindful you will notice where someone might need support – or where maybe not. Train your perception: What do you hear? What do you see? What do you feel? Etc. Keep a diary: What was important today? What did you do well? What could you have done better? Pay attention to the needs of others: Ask how your colleagues are doing and whether you can do something for them. Do you have an unpleasant thought? Write it down. Reflect: Does your thought correspond 100% to reality? Or will it 100% surely happen in the future? Write down the result. Does the thought benefit you? Does it have advantages? And what are the disadvantages? Write the result down as well. What thought would be more appropriate because it is more realistic or helpful to you? Write down this thought and take it with you into everyday life. \u0026hellip;  Regulation of emotions  Instead of \u0026ldquo;letting it out\u0026rdquo;, take a deep breath. Take some distance from yourself. Observe and name the feeling. What thoughts swirl in your head? Consider them as well with a little distance, without evaluating them, without wanting to change them, but also without wanting to get into them. If you feel an unpleasant feeling, choose to perceive it completely. Be mindful. Don\u0026rsquo;t push it away. Usually, it disappears after 60 to 90 seconds. Practice relaxation methods: breathing techniques, meditation, PMR, autogenous training, etc.  Team inclusion practices  Offer your help and support. If you get offered help and need it, accept the offer and don\u0026rsquo;t reject it out of false pride. Build trust: You gain trust by being open and showing the other who you are and what you stand for. Share your strengths, but also your weaknesses. Trust others: Send them a signal that you believe in their abilities and rely on them. Actively ask for the opinion of others and involve the whole team – even the people who are rather passive. Celebrate successes in the team. Value and recognize the achievements of others. If you are happy or grateful for a colleague, let him or her know. Be open. Go into exchanges with others and also accept different opinions. Set common rules for teamwork. \u0026hellip;  Further Information   Hartmann et al.

Digital whiteboards help to transfer this collaborative experience into the digital world.\nWhat is a Digital Whiteboard? Whiteboards only work when the team is in the same space. As work becomes more remote, they are replaced by their digital equivalent. Digital whiteboards help to transfer the collaborative experience of whiteboards into the virtual world. Digital whiteboards are essential in a remote-only setting but also very helpful in hybrid scenarios with distributed teams in different offices, or when some participants are joining from home.\nWhy use it? To enable real-time remote collaboration on whiteboards especially for creative team processes and to stimulate team flow.\nHow to do it? The following picture shows a sample digital whiteboard used for brainstorming based on the tool miro.   img.lazyload { display: none; }  \nHere is our how-to for the different stages of a digital whiteboard session:\n\u0026hellip; prepare a whiteboard session Prepare the session right on the canvas. Try to reflect the meeting agenda directly on the whiteboard: Add the agenda and prepare regions for every agenda item. Visually link the regions according the storyline of the meeting.\nIf the agenda item is a presentation: Include the slides on the whiteboard.\nIf the agenda item is interactive: Choose an appropriate template that facilitates the required group process the most. Good digital whiteboard solutions provide templates for a lot of creative methodologies (like those listed at servicedesigntools.org or Open Practice Library).\nIf the agenda item can be prepared by the team prior to the meeting: Provide the whiteboard upfront and define regions where the participants can insert their content.\nFinally: Lock all parts of the whiteboard which shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be modified during the meeting.\n\u0026hellip; run a whiteboard session Each whiteboard session needs a facilitator who guides the group through the agenda and the corresponding whiteboard. There are basically three different interaction modes during a digital whiteboard session:\n Brainstorming mode, where all participants first insert their ideas, then the ideas are presented and clustered and finally conclusions are derived. Co-edition mode, where a small group of participants (3-5) is editing the same region of the whiteboard simultaneously and all modifications are merged in real-time. Presentation mode, where one participant presents a region of the whiteboard or draws \u0026amp; explains in real-time.  Meeting minutes can be written directly to the whiteboard or on a separate document which is linked to it.\n\u0026hellip; follow-up a whiteboard session After a whiteboard session, it\u0026rsquo;s good practice to send a link to the final whiteboard to all participants and maybe some other effected stakeholders and lock all items on the whiteboard for edits before.\nFurther information Available tools  G2: List of Collaborative Whiteboard Software Digital whiteboards in video conferencing solutions like Zoom, Webex, Teams The leading digital whiteboards: miro and Mural A digital collaboration space for Office 365: Deon Some hardware devices for digital whiteboards: Google Jambaord, Microsoft SurfaceHub  Related items  Video Conferencing Online Retros ","permalink":"https://www.remoteworklibrary.io/posts/tools-digital-whiteboard/","tags":["collaborate"],"title":"Digital Whiteboard"},{"categories":["tool","practice","culture"],"contents":"A Retrospective is an opportunity for the team to inspect itself and to create a plan for improvements to be enacted.\nWhat is an Online Retrospective? According to the Agile Alliance a (heartbeat) retrospective is: \u0026ldquo;The team meets regularly, usually adhering to the rhythm of its iterations, to explicitly reflect on the most significant events to have occurred since the previous such meeting, and take decisions aiming at remediation or improvement.\u0026rdquo;\nAn online retrospective runs a retrospective online with the help of web-based tools.\nWhy use it? According to the Agile Alliance the benefits of a (heartbeat) retrospective are:\n \u0026ldquo;retrospectives leverage the benefits of iterative development: they offer explicit opportunities to improve the team’s performance over the duration of the project retrospectives promote ownership and responsibility by the project team with respect to all aspects of the process; participants can understand the rationale behind all process decisions\u0026rdquo;  An online retrospective transfers these benefits into a remote work setting where all or most of the retro participants are distributed.\nHow to do it? First you\u0026rsquo;ve to choose the structure of the retrospective. Retromat and FunRetrospective are great resources to find effective and fun structures which are mostly defined by the questions they ask. The default questions are: What was good? What to improve?\nA special form of a retrospective are team health checks like those used by Spotify. Good online retro tools also support team health checks.\nAfter the structure is clear and the retro tool is prepared accordingly the retro can be run in several rounds:\nFirst round: Each participant enters the input to the retrospective structure. The team decides whether the input is visible immediately or after the first round is closed.\nSecond round: Each participant presents his/her input and all participants can ask questions of understanding. No discussions!\nThird round: The input is prioritized, clustered and action items are derived as you can see here:   img.lazyload { display: none; }  \nAfter the retrospective, the result is provided to all participants and to other stakeholders. It is good practice to provide feedback to the top lessons learned to the whole organization (e.g. in a Slack channel #lessonslearned) and to use an issue tracking system like JIRA, Trello or Meistertask to track the derived action items.\nFurther information Available tools  TeamRetro Retrium FunRetro Parabol  Retrospective structures  Retromat FunRetrospective Squad Health Checks  Related items  Video Conferencing Health Checks Digital Whiteboard ","permalink":"https://www.remoteworklibrary.io/posts/tools-online-retros/","tags":["collaborate","learn"],"title":"Online Retrospective"},{"categories":["culture"],"contents":"Working remotely - especially from home - can be tough.

Some lack proper working space or equipment, some need to look after their children while working from home. Some miss the strict separation of their work and personal life. We adapt, we improvise, we try our best to keep up, wondering how long it will take for the world to turn back to normal. There will be times in which you\u0026rsquo;re not as productive as you could be. There will be times in which you feel uneasy and alone. Keep in mind that we humans are social beings. We need to surround ourselves with our colleagues, friends and families in order to feel connected and mentally healthy. Yet, this is what we lack that at the moment.

There are some things you can fix by yourself.\nWhat is it and why fix it? WiFi is a so-called shared medium, which means: There\u0026rsquo;s a limited amount of bandwidth, and in crowded areas, there\u0026rsquo;s not enough room for everyone\u0026rsquo;s WiFi. Your WiFi performance is affected not only by the quality of your own equipment, but also by the general frequency congestion, especially if you live in a multi tenant house.\nHow to do it? Before you start optimizing WiFi, check if you can just get rid of it. If you are still not able to run the cable, then it’s time to check your router\u0026rsquo;s WiFi settings (WiFi is good, cable is better).\nWiFi operates on two common frequency bands:\n 2.4 GHz: long range, good transmission through walls and ceilings, widely used, very often congested. Also the only suitable option for REALLY old devices 5 GHz: shorter range, more blockage by walls/ceilings, seldom congested  If you are on 2.4 GHz and having problems, test what happens if you switch to 5 GHz. Not only does it provide more bandwidth, it is usually not as congested as 2.4 GHz. In a large apartment building, it has become almost impossible to run a 2.4 GHz WiFi with acceptable performance.\nIf you are capable of a router that can run 2.4 and 5.0 GHz in parallel, avoid using the same SSID (SSID = Name of the WiFi network) on both frequency bands. Client devices will happily switch between 2.4/5.0 GHz and you won\u0026rsquo;t get stable test results. In that case, it is better to create a separate SSID (i.e. \u0026ldquo;MyWifi-50\u0026rdquo;) and manually switch your client devices to that network, maybe even deleting the credentials for the old one.\nDeeper dive Tools like MetaGeek InSSIDer can measure the network congestion and list the rogue WiFis at your place. Some routers offer the same functionality. Maybe you can convince your neighbor to crank down his super-high intensity WiFi? Higher signal strength makes no-ones WiFi faster, it is just more annoying for the neighbors.\nOh, and by the way, please do your part as well. Test what WiFi output strength you need at your router to reach all locations within your home. The power savings are marginal, but at least you’re not contributing to someone else’s WiFi congestion problems.\nA word about extenders There are several WiFi extenders or repeaters on the market. It\u0026rsquo;s important to understand how these devices work. A repeater is designed to be put in the middle between your router and your PC. It logs into your router\u0026rsquo;s WiFi as a client, then it serves the same WiFi to your PC. By doing that, the overall range of your WiFi is extended, but the network traffic must now be sent twice – to the repeater, then to the router. As a result, the overall throughput between your PC and router is effectively cut in half!\nRepeaters do have their advantages in long-range, low-congestion situations, but this is most likely not what you\u0026rsquo;re currently dealing with.\nRelated items  WiFi is good, cable is better Video Conferencing ","permalink":"https://www.remoteworklibrary.io/posts/optimize-wifi/","tags":["collaborate"],"title":"Optimize your WiFi"},{"categories":["tool"],"contents":"No video call without internet. Right. But why is it slow like in the 90ies even though you purchased a super broadband line from your internet provider?\nWhat is it and why fix it? A remote worker often needs nothing more than his computer and a good internet connection. But what if that\u0026rsquo;s exactly the problem: Too slow, too unstable, too overloaded. Before you consider changing providers or relocating to a different address, check out your equipment on site. According to our analysis, most of the problems are not caused by the internet provider, but by bad WiFi conditions. This article provides alternatives to slow and unstable WiFi connections.\nHow to do it? There’s several components between your laptop and the internet. Their overall performance cannot exceed the performance of their weakest link. Surprisingly often, you can optimize throughput without contacting your internet provider.\nWiFi is good, cable is better No exceptions! Whenever you are able to connect via an ethernet cable instead of WiFi, just do it! Consider this: A common FullHD video stream in a digital meeting is well below 3 MBit/s. Even the (slightly outdated) 54 MBit/s WiFi setups would handle that, if only you could provide a perfect environment. Then reality kicks in and adds latency, congestion and concrete walls. Just run a cable in the first place and save yourself A LOT of trouble.\nGet creative Yes. Running the cable across your house can be a lot of work. It might still be worth the effort, considering the current circumstances. Probably you will be working from home for the next months or a year. Do it early, get the maximum out of it.\nWorkarounds exist for more complex situations. Powerline adapters use the electricity lines in your house to transmit data on top. The Throughput can reach Gigabit and the adapters are not expensive.\n   img.lazyload { display: none; }    Powerline Adapter (source: https://avm.de/produkte/fritzpowerline/fritzpowerline-1260e-wlan-set/)      img.lazyload { display: none; }    Super-flat CAT cable for windowframes (source: https://www.wentronic.com/en/ultra-slim-rj45-window-feed-through-025-m-71411)   Vertical distance can be a bigger problem than horizontal distance. What if your router is in the basement but your workplace is on the 2nd floor? Consider running the cable on the outside wall. Super-flat ethernet cables will fit within window frames and underneath doors. Use RJ45 couplers to connect them. Don’t be too worried about weather conditions, just make sure that you keep the connectors dry and/or cover them in lots of tape. Warning: Never do anything like this with power supply lines (high voltage electricity)!\nIf you just can\u0026rsquo;t reach your desk If you still can’t reach your workplace, would you be able to cover at least part of the distance via cable, to place an additional WiFi access point at a more suitable location?\nWould you be able to relocate your router? Some houses have multiple telephone sockets available. Also, the cable that connects the telephone socket to your router can be even smaller in diameter than a CAT cable.\nJust in case If none of the above works for you, then you\u0026rsquo;ll probably have to stick with WiFi.

Via a chat tool you can communicate with other team members 1:1 or in (larger) groups. This comes in handy especially if the team is distributed.\nWhy use it? Using chats, a distributed team can communicate quickly and easily - almost as if they would sit next to each other. This way a chat tool also helps to maintain the social and corporate culture in remote settings.\nHow to do it? Just as in a regular conversation, it is important to note that certain rules of communication also apply in chat communications:\n always be aware of the range and the target group of the message read the message carefully again before sending and ask yourself how your counterpart might perceive it and whether you have expressed yourself clearly. If the formulations are unclear, correct them. pay attention to give sufficient context so that the message is understandable note the standard rules of communication (Hello, Hi, Please, Thank You; no insults) communicate appreciative and do not critisise without having a constructive solution/alternative at hand when a situation gets tense, seek 1:1 conversation over phone or video call keep the messages as short and concise as possible.

There are excellent tools for getting input quickly and easily.\nWhat is an instant feedback and why use it? \u0026ldquo;A smile often says more than a thousand words\u0026rdquo;. A simple honest smile is an instant feedback, for example on a decision made in a meeting. What might be simple in a meeting room quickly becomes a challenge in a video call or in an asynchronous communication via email or messenger. In this case you always have to explicitly aks for feedback, often during a meeting to make the right decisions to have an agreement for the next steps.\nHow to do it? Thumbs up In small meeting rounds it is easiest if you explicitly add a short feedback question with each decision: How do you feel about the decision? Thumbs up, thumbs down or ok? We call these polls \u0026ldquo;Flash Light Polls\u0026rdquo; and they are most easily comparable as a mix of Traffic Light Polls and Muddiest Point (CATs). In a second round participants who have shown their thumbs down can briefly explain their disagreement in one sentence and propose a compromise solution. The goal of this exercise is to enable the moderator to quickly measure the confidence of all participants on a topic.\nIn a remote meeting, such a survey can be technically implemented very quickly:\n In a video conference, each participant holds their thumb or a traffic light card into the camera. Some video conferencing tools offer features for non-verbal communication. For example Zoom     img.lazyload { display: none; }    Zoom non-verbal communication icons   Polls If you don\u0026rsquo;t like analog polls so much, you can use a bunch of digital tools for Instand Feedback polls.\nVideo Conferencing Polls Good video conferencing tools have poll features integrated in their clients.

Depending on the messenger, polls are already included out-of-the-box in the product or can be added as an extension. A very popular extension for Slack and Microsoft teams is Polly.\n  The fastest way to set up an Instant Feedback poll with Polly in Slack are Yes-No questions. These can be created with one slash command in a channel.\n/yesno Do we have to discuss a second example, or can we move on to the next agenda item?    img.lazyload { display: none; }    YesNo poll visualization in Slack channel   For simple surveys you do not necessarily need an extension.

This happens with telepresence hardware.\nWhat is Telepresence? Telepresence groups together technical solutions that promise to solve three problems:\n to make a person feel present at a remote location to make other people feel that there is someone remotely present to be able to perform actions at a remote location (for example with telerobotics)  Why use it? During face-to-face meetings with a small number of remote participants, they are easily overlooked and quickly get lost. Telepresence tooling makes it possible that remote participants are also recognized as part of the presence group and can actively participate in the meeting.\nHow to do it? There are different solutions that address at least one of the three problems mentioned above. Single solutions are cheaper, less complex and can be integrated easily into the remote office everyday business.\nTelepresence cameras Smart camera systems in meeting rooms or offices are a solution to problem #1: As a remote participant you have to be able to see all participants of the face-to-face meeting. The person who is speaking should always be in focus. But if you are familiar with real life meetings you know that the active participant in a meeting can quickly change.\nConference room systems usually solve this problem with a wide-angle camera which permanently captures all participants in a meeting.\n360° cameras with integrated omnidirectional microphones and speakers that support a variety of video conferencing platforms (Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Webex, GotoMeeting, \u0026hellip;) are a good and cost-efficient start. A product line from this category are the Meeting Owl products from Owl Labs. The best feature of Meeting Owl is that the camera automatically focuses on the speaker. The result is an experience that almost feels like sitting side-by-side in one room with the team.\n The Meeting Owl smart video conferencing camera captures 360° video and audio for a near face-to-face experience.\n   Another product in this category is the 360° camera Meeting from Kandao. This camera supports three different modes of operation:\n 360° panorama of all participants and smart auto focus on the current speaker In presentation mode the speaker is always automatically in focus In global mode, two 180° panorama shots are displayed one above the other    Tabletop telepresence Simply explained, tabletop telepresence systems are tablet PCs on a motor-driven arm. The devices are a technical solution for problem 1 and 2. The device is placed on a meeting table as if there is a meeting participant sitting at that position. The remote participant can remotely control his tabletop telepresence system and thus take part in what is happening at the table or on the whiteboard of the meeting room. The hardware components of the tablet are used for communication (microphone, speakers, camera). The participants in the meeting room can see the remote participant on the tablet monitor.\nSystems of this type are best suited if a single person cannot attend a face-to-face meeting. The people in the meeting room can interact with the remote participant\u0026rsquo;s clone in an almost natural way. An example of such a system is KUBI.\n  Telepresence robots Telepresence robots are the all-in-one solution for the three problems mentioned above. In addition to the features of tabletop telepresence systems, telepresence robots allow free movement in the room and, depending on the model, also have grippers or other possibilities for physical interaction. Thus, these systems are also well suited to participate in meetings with position or room transfers.\nAs one can move independently, these systems are also suitable for \u0026ldquo;just cruising around\u0026rdquo; the office, meeting colleagues or have conversations in the coffee kitchen.\nThe first video shows a telepresence robot from Double Robotics in everyday office life at Wework.\n  The second video shows a robot from Origin Robotics with a controllable gripper arm.

A remote meeting guideline provides guidance on how to keep them productive.\nWhat is a Remote Meeting Guideline? Running effective meetings is essential for modern businesses - and it\u0026rsquo;s even more difficult when they take place virtually. A remote meeting guideline provides guidance on how to succeed here. It\u0026rsquo;s a collection of rules and best practices on how to run effective virtual meetings.\nWhy use it? Without a special guideline, virtual meetings will more or less be held like meetings in presence. But this leads to inefficiency as successful remote meetings require more facilitation and more discipline. Also, they should not last too long as meeting remotely is more exhausting than meeting on-site.\nHow to do it? A sample remote meeting guideline General rules  Virtual meetings are more exhausting than meetings in presence. No meeting should take more than 2 hours and you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t spend more than 4 hours in remote meetings per day. Remote meetings require more discipline and thus also a strong leadership of a meeting. Each virtual meeting must have an pre-assigned host. Please refer to general meeting hosting and facilitation best practices.  Meeting preparation All participants:\n Take care of an appropriate infrastructure and the required technical setup  Internet access: prefer LAN/PowerLAN connection over WiFi Camera: Notebook cameras are OK, HD USB cameras are way better Audio: The notebook audio setup is mostly not sufficient for video conferences. Use headsets or speakerphones and activate noise and echo reduction.   Take care of having enough to drink for the meeting (e.g. a 1l bottle of water) Form the new habit to join the meeting 2 minutes in advance.  As host:\n Ensure that every participant has access to the agenda and has a video conferencing link to join the meeting. It is good practice keeping this information in the calendar entry. Keep the number of participants as low as possible (5-9). Two suggestions:  \u0026ldquo;no spectators\u0026rdquo;: Do not invite participants only to keep them informed. Everybody should be invited to actively participate and contribute an otherwise missing opinion. \u0026ldquo;free participants from the meeting\u0026rdquo;: Start the meeting with the question if any participant thinks she/he isn\u0026rsquo;t mandatory for the meeting and would prefer not to participate.   Provide an agenda with a schedule and a sufficient number of breaks (communication breaks and rejuvenation breaks). Prepare rules for common pitfalls in remote meetings like: Who talks? In meetings with more than 5 non-steady participants it could be useful that each participant only talks upon request by the host and after digitally raising the hand. For the introduction or feedback rounds the sequence should be made clear for all. Interactive parts require proper preparation: It is often better to collect the participant input upfront or in parallel during the meeting with tools like a common online document, an online retro board, or a digital whiteboard. Prepare the required tools for the remote meeting  for managing the agenda and the meeting minutes (Wiki page like Confluence, online documents like GoogleDocs) for collecting the action items (issue trackers like JIRA or taskboards like Trello or Meistertask) for collaborative digital whiteboard sessions for online retrospectives for breakout sessions (Zoom can handle this on-the-fly. For others separate video conferencing sessions should be prepared as breakout rooms) time timer: Smartphone, real time timer visible in video stream, digital timers like AgilePokerClock or the Online Time Timer.    Running the Meeting All participants:\n always switch on the video. Facial expression and body language are an important part of communication. Only switch the video off if you\u0026rsquo;ve troubles with the internet connection or if you participate in a large meeting where you have no active parts. keep the focus on the meeting  do not work on other tasks in parallel (not even on e-mails and chats) do not use your smartphone do not change the virtual background during the meeting   only one person speaks simultaneously all others mute themselves. Only the host can interrupt. Participants can raise their hand in the chat or with the according feature of the video conferencing solution. take a break for 5-15 min each 60-90 min and come back from the break in time. Keep video and microphones on during the breaks for small talk and networking (take every chance to do team building in remote settings)  As host:\n Take care of the agenda and follow the schedule. It\u0026rsquo;s good practice nominating a time keeper (≠ the host) to take care of the schedule. Use a time timer to make all participants aware of the timebox and the remaining time. Provide an intro to each agenda item setting the context, the goals, the approach, and the desired outcome. Provide a summary after each agenda item and collect the results, the open issues, the action items and next steps. Document all results and provide meeting minutes for all participants and affected stakeholders. It\u0026rsquo;s good practice nominating a recorder to take care of the meeting minutes.

The typist writes the program code while sharing the screen for all others (e.g. with video conferencing tool). All participants watch the shared source code and collaborate on solving the problem. They discuss the best solution and tell the typist what to do.\nTips  All team members turn on their video and audio. To ensure all participants stay concentrated and active, the typist role should switch frequently (every 8-10 minutes). Keep the team small! If there are six or more participants, they often are inactive. Try to keep everyone involved. The concept of mob programming can also be used to write documentation or tests.

But how to perform effective collaboration practices like pair programming or code walkthroughs in remote settings?\nWhat is Collaborative Coding? Collaborative coding is about interpreting coding as a collaborative effort and providing tools and practices which improve the depth and productivity of code-level collaboration - especially in fully or partially remote settings.\nWhy use it? Important code-level collaborative practices like pair programming, code walkthroughs, and walking around and ask others for feedback do not work out-of-the-box in remote settings.\nHow to do it? There are at least three different kinds of collaborative code practices which can be enabled by different kinds of tools:\n Social coding: Code sharing and accessibility (with tools like GitHub, Gitlab), and Bitbucket Driver / navigator pattern: The driver writes code, and the navigator tells the driver what to do. Driver and navigator swap their roles from time to time. You need nothing more than a video conferencing solution for a driver / navigator collaboration. Code discussions: Comment, peer review, and discuss code with inline comments, Google Docs like commenting \u0026amp; suggestion features (e.g. provided by codestream, TeamHub), peer review tools (like Upsource), or pull/merge requests in social coding tools. Co-creation: Writing code together simultaneously by working in a shared editor. Changes of everybody are visible in realtime. There are desktop-level co-creation tools like USE together which are not stitched to any dev tool or realtime collaboration editors like floobits, VS.code Live Share, or Atom Teletype  Further information Related items  Mob Programming Video Conferencing ","permalink":"https://www.remoteworklibrary.io/posts/collaborative-coding/","tags":["collaborate","learn"],"title":"Collaborative Coding"},{"categories":["tool"],"contents":"Video conferencing is a fundamental technology in remote work settings. It brings teams close together even if there are huge physical distances in between.\nWhat is Video Conferencing? Video conferencing is a tool to enable multiple participants (1:1 up to hundreds) to communicate: by voice, video, chat, and screen sharing.\nWhy use it? Without video conferencing your fallback solutions are phone calls and e-mails. Trust me: you don\u0026rsquo;t want to run into these fallback solutions\u0026hellip;\nHow to do it? Best practices:\n always switch on the video. Only switch it off if you\u0026rsquo;ve troubles with the internet connection or if you participate in a large meeting where you have no active parts keep the focus on the meeting use virtual backgrounds to avoid visual distractions learn the most important hot keys: start/stop screen sharing, mute/unmute, push-to-talk, mute others (host only) show support without speaking: raise hand, +1 in chat avoid interruptions with questions and write your feedback in the chat get dressed like in the office get to know the power features of your video conferencing solution like breakout rooms, polls, integrated whiteboards etc.  Further best practices for online meetings: see Meeting Guidelines\nFurther information Available tools  Google Meet Zoom Microsoft Teams BlueJeans Webex GotoMeeting Jitsi (Open Source)  Related items  Meeting Guidelines ","permalink":"https://www.remoteworklibrary.io/posts/video-conferencing/","tags":["collaborate","learn","socialize"],"title":"Video Conferencing"}]
