Mindfulness is a key to personal satisfaction, but also to good relationships at work. If you are mindful, you will notice more quickly when you are tired, or when a meeting has ended with an ambiguity.

If you are mindful, you perceive your counterpart better. How is your colleague really doing? Did he really understand what you told him? Is there irritation between you, or do you get along well?

Mindful people are more empathic, they experience fewer conflicts and are more satisfied at work. They also recognize their personal limits easier. In the home office it is more difficult to perceive oneself and others. Attention is very focused on the laptop, and the natural body language in any encounter is limited to a few elements, which can also provide opportunities for misunderstandings.

For self-awareness despite being at your home office you can do the following:

* Take a break once an hour at work, during which you can get up, stretch, maybe open the window, and consciously recognize how you are feeling.
* Establish good habits that help you do what is important for your balance.
* Spend at least half an hour on your own, without distraction from digital media. Go for a walk, clean up in peace, meditate, or read a book

For a mindful approach to others you can do the following:

* Ask in meetings what your counterpart has understood exactly and if he or she has more questions.
* Ask how your counterpart is doing personally. As spontaneous conversations at the coffee machine do not take place, more explicit interest is needed.
* Mirror your observations: You look as if you are in a good mood today, or: you look tired today, and ask if your impression is right.
* Deliberately give appreciation. Thank others for work done, praise good results or diligence, or simply support spontaneously.
