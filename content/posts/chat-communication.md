Instant messaging tools simplify the communication in remote work settings if you stick to a few basic rules.

## What is Chat Communication?

Via a chat tool you can communicate with other team members 1:1 or in (larger) groups. This comes in handy especially if the team is distributed.

## Why use it?

Using chats, a distributed team can communicate quickly and easily - almost as if they would sit next to each other. This way a chat tool also helps to maintain the social and corporate culture in remote settings.

## How to do it?

Just as in a regular conversation, it is important to note that certain rules of communication also apply in chat communications:

* always be aware of the range and the target group of the message
* read the message carefully again before sending and ask yourself how your counterpart might perceive it and whether you have expressed yourself clearly. If the formulations are unclear, correct them.
* pay attention to give sufficient context so that the message is understandable
* note the standard rules of communication (Hello, Hi, Please, Thank You; no insults)
* communicate appreciative and do not critisise without having a constructive solution/alternative at hand
* when a situation gets tense, seek 1:1 conversation over phone or video call
* keep the messages as short and concise as possible. For larger texts make use of the formatting functions to increase readability or write an e-mail.
* try to reduce notifications, e.g. by bundling the request/message
* use status options to show your availability
* be aware that messages are not always answered immediately
